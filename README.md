# HeightenedCause
 
 This is my first relatively big programming project. A 2D game based on C++ and Openframeworks. All the colision and gravity system is written by me.
 
## How to play

  In the bin folder, execute GameTest_debug.exe
  
### Controls
  
   Use 'A'/'Left arrow key' and D/[Right arrow key] to move left and right
   Use 'S'/'Doan arrow key' to crouch
   Use 'w'/'Up arrow key' to jump
   
   Hold jump while crouching to charge Super Jump, after the meter is full, the character will automatically jump
   
   Green: goal, press up to enter. Only one in demo stage
   Blue: Jump pad, makes you jump higher. No need to charge
   Red: Lava, kills you if touched.
